While deciding no. of partitions for your data

1) The lower bound for spark partitions is determined by 2 X number of cores in the cluster available to application.
2) Determining the upper bound for partitions in Spark, the task should take 100+ ms time to execute. 
   If it takes less time, then the partitioned data might be too small or the application might be spending extra time in scheduling tasks.
   
 There are two ways, which spark supports to parition data
 1) Hash Partitioning in Spark
 2) Range Partitioning in Spark

 Paritions on Spark
 -- Parition is the smallest unit of work that Spark handles.
 -- By default parition of data will be done based on block size of HDFS (which is 128 MB)
      Example: If you have data of 1 GB 
                By default total of partitions SPark will create is 1024/128 = 8 Partitions
       
 -- What does this have to do with our limit? Well a partition to Spark is basically the smallest unit of work that Spark will handle. 
    This means for several operations Spark needs to allocate enough memory to store an entire Partition. 
     It stores the Partition with Java structures whose size is determined by an Integer. 
     This leads to our 2GB limit, if a single Partition exceeds 2GB of memory and needs to be shuffled or cached we will run into problems.
 
 -- Shuffle operations leads to change in partitions, which can be of unlimited size, thats when 2GB comes into the picture.
